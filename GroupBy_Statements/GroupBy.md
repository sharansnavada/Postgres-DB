# GROUP BY in PostgreSQL

##  GROUP BY

The **GROUP BY** clause in PostgreSQL is used to **arrange identical data into groups**. It helps you summarize data by one or more columns and is commonly used with **aggregate functions** such as:

- `COUNT()` â†’ counts the number of rows in each group  
- `SUM()` â†’ adds up numeric values in each group  
- `AVG()` â†’ calculates the average value in each group  
- `MAX()` â†’ finds the maximum value in each group  
- `MIN()` â†’ finds the minimum value in each group

```
